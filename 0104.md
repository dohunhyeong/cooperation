### make the workingdirectory and check you're working in your workingdirectory

## second.
### if there's no message kind of (main), (master), you're not in your working directory
### type " git init " so that you can make .git folder. 
### after making . git file, you can manage your files under the branch of .git folder

### let's say you face the error because of the .git folder..
### then just delete .git folder. then your codes will remain but that codes will not be managed any longer.
